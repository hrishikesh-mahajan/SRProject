## Project Title

AI Assignment Assessment Bot

## Problem Statement

Design and implement an AI Assignment Assessment Bot that is triggered by a student's submission of an assignment. The bot will assess the student's submission and provide feedback to the student. The bot will also provide a grade for the assignment.

## Problem Statement Breakdown (Objectives)

- Triggered when a student submits an assignment.
- Check for expected format from the lab manual or assignment description or a verified copy.
- Check for plagiarism (optionally) and AI detection using NLP and Transformers.
- Generate an overall report and provide feedback to the student.
- Compile all the reports in a single spreadsheet file for the faculty to review.

## Outcomes

- The bot will be able to assess the student's submission and provide feedback to the student.
- The bot will be able to provide a grade for the assignment.
- Faculties can easily assess the student's submission.
